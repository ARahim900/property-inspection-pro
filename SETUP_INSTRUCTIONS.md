   - If not, click "New Project" and create one

3. **Get Your API Credentials**
   - In your project dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
   - Copy the **Project URL** (looks like: `https://abcdefghijk.supabase.co`)
   - Copy the **anon/public** key (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

## Step 2: Configure Your Environment

1. **Open the `.env.local` file** (already created for you)
2. **Replace the placeholder values**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here
   ```

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Click on **SQL Editor**
3. Run the SQL scripts from the `scripts/` folder in order
4. Or check the `DATABASE_SETUP.md` file for detailed instructions
